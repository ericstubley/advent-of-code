part a

you're given a picture of the universe
compute the sum of the lengths of the shortest (manhattan metric) paths between all the pairs of galaxies
each universe row or column that is devoid of galaxies is double size

warp == columns
weft == rows


tighten up the reader monad functions
they are a disaster


part b

do the computation but with an expansion factor of 1000000 instead of 2
