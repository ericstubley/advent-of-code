part a

given a list of lines
extract the first and last digits from each line
add those up is the answer


part b

there's digits spelled out in the lines like "nine"
taking those into account do the same thing
also they might overlap, so "eightwo" should be parsed as 82


oof yikes this was like the least elegant parsing I've ever done :(
