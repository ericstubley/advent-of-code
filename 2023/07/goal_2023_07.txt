part a 

you're given a bunch of card hands
and rules for ranking them
order them and then take the sum of the 1-indexed position * the bid


part b

same basic structure, except now the J is a joker
for the purposes of determining hand type they can play the role of anything else
same computation, but with a different ordering


what's the logic?
based on number of jokers
...yeah just do it


is there a non-casework way to do it?
ooooo is there a clever bitwork way to represent things?
