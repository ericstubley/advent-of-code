part a

you're given a list of reports on springs
the reports have lists of spring in operational|damaged|unknown condition
and a spec for the runs of continguous damaged springs

for each report, how many assignments of unknown result in a valid report?
sum those up

good strat but slow because you generated and ran through whole list rather than doing the search with unknowns still in place


part b

the reports are folded up
replace each row with 5 copies of itself, separated by ?
replace each dup with 5 copies of itself


rewrite as suggested above for part b and retry
