part a

machines are wired together with cables
not direct, cables are wird to communication modules
modules communicate with pulses, which are long or short
module sends its pulse to the whole list of destination modules


module types
flip-flop: prefixed by %
    start off
    if receive high pulse do nothing
    if receive low pulse toggle state 
        off -> on send high
        on -> off send low
conjunction: prefixed by &
    start remembering low for all inputs
    updated memory when pulse is received
    if all inputs high send low
    else send high
broadcaster
    when receive send to each destination
button
    no inputs
    when pushed send a low pulse to broadcast


pulses processed in sequence
until they stop for each button push



the elves push the button 1000 times
what is the product of the total number of low pulses * the total number of high pulses



part b


how many button pushes until a single low pulse is sent to rx?

not using lenses very well..... oh well

figure it out by hand, very structured
