part a

you're given a list of races, where each has an allotted time and a distance to (strictly) beat

you get to hold down the charge button for n milliseconds, which increases your speed to n millimeters per millisecond
in a race with time T if you charge for n milliseconds you travel (T-n)*n

for each of the races how many winning strategies are there?
take the product of the number of winning strategies per race

could also solve by hand


part b

there's actually just one race, with the product of all the times and distances
this is just a single polynomial

for how many integer n is Tn - n^2 - D > 0?
this is a downwards opening parabola, so finite answer
just find the root and then its the width of the interval between them
...or do it the naive way, still pretty fast...



the better general solution is the root finding one but its late and I'm not interested in floating point requiring solutions
