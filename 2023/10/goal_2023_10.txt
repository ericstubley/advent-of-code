part a

you're given a map of a bunch of maps, and there's an animal in them whose starting point is marked with S
the animal is in a large loop
how many steps does it take to get to the farthest position away?


part b 

how many tiles are enclosed by the loop?
for some definition of enclosed


you could do it with fill
- mark the "left" and "right" sides of the path (involves logic for marking around corners)
- do a bfs fill with each of the two marked segments
- either pick the smaller or pick the one which never hit the edge



or you could use the shoelace formula!
given a polygon with vertices P1,...,Pn the area is 
1/2  sum_1^n |det ((xi xi+) (yi yi+))

think of each grid square as being made of 4 smaller squares
each path square contributes an amortized 2 to the area (turns contribute 1 or 3, but area always paired up in a closed rectilinear path) except that there's a four corners who pair with each other amortizing out to 1 each, hence the +4 in the formula

so the number of grid squares, given the area A and length of the path L is
(4*A - 2*L + 4)/4

F7
LJ
L = 4
A = 1

F-7
L-J
L = 6
A = 2



along a straight edge the shoelace formula works
|xi (xi+L)| = |Lyi|
|yi  yi   |
which is the same as the sum of |L| things of absolute value |yi|
