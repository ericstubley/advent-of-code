part a

its a filtering challenge
you're given a list of workflows and parts
(workflows accept or reject parts)
what is the sum of the guts of each accepted part?

part b

each internal of a part can have a value in [1..4000]
of the 4000^4 possible parts, how many are accepted?


doesn't look like thing are called more than once so don't bother with memo

pass in lower and upper parts
return sum diameters of the non-empty ones


if empty return 0

for restrict
if constraint is x < 5648
    want to replace x by min x 5647
for remain
    want to replace x by max 5648

if constraint is x > 4378
    want to replace x by max x 4379


102514218799622 is too low :cry:, feels like it should be a more whole number
167409079868000 for the test example

stupid typo, put x instead of s in one of the guards
