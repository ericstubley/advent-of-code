part a

a grid of mirrors
a beam of light enters from the top left, travelling right
squares that light passes through are energized
the beam can split

how many squares are energized?

iterative solution
have a queue to process
and a set of vertices which have been energized, along with the direction that light was travelling in
once the queue has been processed, map down the set of (Ix2, Dir) -> Ix2 and count


part b

you could enter from any direction! find the max
