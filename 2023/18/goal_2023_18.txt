part a

how big a lagoon does it fill?
can compute easily if non-self-intersecting so let's check that
let's try to use shoelace again

00 01
10 11 should get total area of 4
but right now it gets 1

4*a + 2*l + 4/4
4 + 8 - 4/4 = 16/4 = 4

###
### should get 6
but it actually gets 2


4*a + 2*l + 4/4
8 + 12 + 4/4 = 24


part b

parsing is actually different, the second half (what you thought was colour) actually gives directions

just a bigger grid
shoelace still works
