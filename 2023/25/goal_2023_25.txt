part a


you're given a graph
find the 3 wires you need to cut in order to create two connected components


dumb idea: try all sets of 3 wires

1261 vertices
something like 3-4x that many edges

network flow, with two randomly chosen vertices as source and sink?
or pick one as source and try others as sink


... oof you're too lazy to implement that

let's take the approach of hacking on learning how to use a library
and then manual inspection




"vgf" "jpn"
"fdb" "txm"
"nmz" "mnl"
are the edges to remove
