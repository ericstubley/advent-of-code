part a

you're given a bunch of grids
each has either a vertical or horizontal line of symmetry between cols/rows

if vertical, find number of cols to left of line
if horizontal, find 100*number of rows above line
add those up


part b

each mirror has exactly one smudge
that gives a new reflection line
for each option count the total number of errors, return true when there's exactly one


unified solution
count the number of errors for each possible reflection line
in part a choose the one whose total is 0, in part b choose the total is 1
