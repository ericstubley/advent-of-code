part a

you're given a grid with numbers and symbols on it, representing the engine
any (many-digit) number which is adjacent (including diagonal) to a symbol is a part number

what is the sum of the part numbers?

strat:
parse out a list of (number, identifying coord)
parse out a set of symbol coords
have function to generate boundary coords of a (number, identifying coord)
filter by any of the boundary coords is in the set of symbols


part b

find the gear ratio sum
a gear is a * symbol which is adjacent to exactly two numbers
its gear ratio is the product of those two numbers



this was not elegant because there was a lot of futzing about with indices
was there a better strategy?
conceivable you could work hard with massiv to do this
