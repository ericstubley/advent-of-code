part a

playing a "draw from bag" game with an elf
given a list of game of the form
Game n: red k, blue a; green x, red y; blue l
many drawings with replacement from a bag containing red, green, blue cubes

also given a limit red 12, green 13, blue 14

what is the sum of the game ids, of those games which are feasible?


part b

for each game, what is the smallest bag that it could have come from?
just take the max of each coordinate across the draws

the power of a bag is product of the numbers of cubes
what is the sum of the powers of the smallest bags?


somehow there's two <> instances on Cubes, + and max
you're using + in construction and envelope is just max
