part a

you're given a list of lottery cards in the format
Card n: numbers | numbers
the first set is the winning numbers, the second is the numbers you have
the score of a card is 2^(k-1) for k>=1 matches

what is the sum of the scores of the cards?

(making the assumption that within a set of winning numbers or scratched numbers there's no repeats)



part b

actually you got the rules wrong
each scratchcard makes you win copies of the cards below it
if card 1 has a score of 4, you get one more copy of the the four cards below it (2, 3, 4, 5)
each of those then generates more cards
you're guaranteed to never go off the end

yup did it in O(n) because the list of numbers and hence lookahead is bounded
so at each step doing at most O(k) chunks of adding and list manipulation
