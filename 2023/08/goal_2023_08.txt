part a

you're given a list of left right maps instructions
and a path to follow of LRLRLLRLRL

keep following the path on loop starting at AAA until you get to ZZZ
how many steps does it take?


part b

now you have to walk all of the nodes ending with 'A' at the same time
how many steps until they're all ending at 'Z'

okay let's verify if the things all follow one path




make an environment for the instructions and node network

for each starting point you can compute the whole path until you get to a repeated (node, index)
use that to project forward the times when you're at a Z
for each find the indices mod the period when it is at a Z

lcm the periods
look at multiples of the period where you have the right mod for each
