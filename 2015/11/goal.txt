part a

you need to help santa pick a new password, starting with his old one
you increment it, treating it like a base 26 number
passwords are 8 lowercase letters
additional constraints
- one increasing seq of 3 letters like abc, def, ... up to xyz
- may not contain the letters i o l
- must have two different non overlapping pairs like aa, bb, up to zz
    unclear if something like aabcaaaa is valid (do the letters have to be different? probably)


part b

santa's password expired again! what's the next one



would it be better to store it as a straight number out of base 26?
- for checking validity its easiest to have a list of chars or digits; neither is especially easier
- for getting the next its easiest to have a straight number
