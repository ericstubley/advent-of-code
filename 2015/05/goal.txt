part a

help santa filter out the nice strings from the naughty strings
a string is nice if
- it contains at least 3 vowels (aeiou only)
- it contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row
- it doesn't contain one of the banned substrings ab, cd, pq, xy

how many strings are nice?


part b

the rules from part a were clearly ridiculous, the proper nice string rules are
- it contains a pair of letters which appears at least twice without overlapping: so the pair xy appears twice in xyxy or xybcxy without overlapping; aa appears twice in aaa but with overlap so that doesn't count
- contains a repeated letter separated by one letter, so any string like aha, yuy, did, things like that

how many strings are nice with these rules?



you're just doing it by hand
the "fancier" options are
- regex to do the matching rather than writing the logic yourself
- is this what a parser combinator is for? not really
