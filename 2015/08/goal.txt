part a

you're given a list of strings, which can contain escaped characters \\, \", and \xNM
"\xa8br\x8bjr\""
"nq"
"zjrfcpbktjmrzgsz\xcaqsc\x03n\"huqab"
"daz\\zyyxddpwk"
...

and you have to compute the difference between:
- the total number of characters in the file (minus whitespace)
- and the total number of characters in memory for the strings themselves

so for example
"\x27" uses 6 characters, but is really a 1 character string


part b

now go the other way
encode each string as a new string where you replace each \ with an escaped slash, each " with an escaped \" etc
