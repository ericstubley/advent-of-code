part a

you're given a list of present dimensions (rectangular lxwxh)
for each present you need the surface area + the area of the smallest face as slack, which amounts to 2*l*w + 2*l*h + 2*w*h + slack
what is the total area required?

part b

now we need to help them with ribbon
need a wrapping length = the shortest distance around any of the sides = the smallest perimeter of a face
and a bow length = the total cubic volume
