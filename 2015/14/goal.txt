part a

we're seeing which of santa's reindeer is the fastest
each reindeer is either flying at its top speed, which it can do for a certain time period, or resting for a certain time period
everything happens in intervals of whole seconds

after 2503 seconds what distance has the winning reindeer travelled?


part b

we need a better scoring system
at the end of every second, the reindeer in the lead gets a single point
whoever has the most points after 2503 seconds wins

how many points does the winner have after 2503 seconds?


my solution is going to be inefficient in that it actually totally recomputes the distances at each step rather than updating
but at the scale we're working at it's fine



finally made a mistake
but it was a typo from poorly hardcoding 2503 and not an actual conceptual error in the code
