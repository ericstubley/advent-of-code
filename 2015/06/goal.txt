part a

given a 1000x1000 grid of lights, and a list of instructions which are of the form
    turn on 887,9 through 959,629
(i.e. turn on/off or toggle a given rectangle in the grid)
how many lights are lit after doing all the instructions?
the lights all start out turned off


part b

in fact the lights do more than that
- turn on increases brightness by 1
- toggle increases brightness by 2
- turn off decreases brightness by 1, stopping below at 0

what is the total brightness?
