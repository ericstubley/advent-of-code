part a

you're given a list of cookie ingredients and their properties per teaspoon
a recipe is a linear combination of the ingredients, and then the score is the length of some vector
want to find ingredients which maximize the score
is this the simplex algorithm? there's probably a better than brute force approach

total ingredients must be 100 teaspoons
for each attribute you compute a total score (clipping at 0 if its negative)
product of these attributes is the final score

it seems to me that there should be a faster way than brute force, but I'm not seeing it


part b

find best scoring cookie whose calories are 500
again its just a linear constraint
again it seems like there should be a better method


you made a mistake on part a
but it was because you didn't test your recipe generating function!
all you had to do to fix and understand the error was look at the output of your recipe generating function
didn't fit easily into test setup but that shouldn't stop you
