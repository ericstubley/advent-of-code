part a

the look-and-say sequence (one of the first programs you ever wrote I think! :D)

1221 becomes 112211 becomes 212221 becomes 12113211

starting input is 1321131112
what is length after 40 iterations?

store as a list rather than a string is I think the way to go

part b

do it 50 times instead


did it fine (10 days no mistakes!) but violated the < 1 second runtime rule on part b
let's optimize
