part a

you're given a list of cities and distances between them
you want to find a path which starts and ends at two different locations and which has the shortest total distance
has to visit each location exactly once


the given graph is a complete graph on 8 vertices
can you just greedy do it by hand? not so easy


brute force is not so bad? there's 8! = 40320 many choices
(and if you wanted you could cut that in half by ignoring the reverse path)


part b

what's the longest path?
literally just change a min to a max
