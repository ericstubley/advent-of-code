part a

playing the game again, but this time as a wizard
you have a mana pool
each turn you cast a spell, some of which have ongoing effects

what is the smallest amount of mana you can spend in total and still win the fight?


memoized recursive with a game state?
need to be careful with that since games can last an arbitrarily long time thanks to mana recharge, and drain?
probably not actually but games could be real long



2 hp, mana, boss_damage, 3 timers is game state, turn
50*71*500*6*6*5*2 = 639,000,000 is approx the number of possibilities
but we're unlikely to see most of them



TESTING FTW
the places where you had mistakes where the code pathways you didn't test!
also modifying something for the sake of a test results in you forgetting to modify it back for the real thing
and some mistakes from changing requirements around (i.e. when you apply spell effects vs testing for castability gave you trouble)
but thanks to the testing that was remarkably painless to debug
also good god I'm still amazed at the memoization
namedtuple was a good choice


part b

hard mode: at the start of each player turn you lose one hit point
same question: what's the smallest amount of mana you can spend and still win?
