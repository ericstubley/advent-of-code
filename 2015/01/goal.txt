part a

santa is taking an elevator, and the instructions are a big string of '(' and ')'.
open paren means go up 1 floor, close paren means go down 1 floor
if he starts from 0 what floor does santa end up at?

fortunately the operations are commutative so we just need to
- count the number of ( minus the number of )
- loop over the string once to get a running total

looping over the string once is better in general?
- only one pass instead of two
- better chance that the ints involved remain small
- can read from a feed rather than having to store the whole thing in memory


part b

find the position (indexed starting from 1) of the first character which causes santa to enter the basement
