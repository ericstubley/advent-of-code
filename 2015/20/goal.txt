part a

elves are labelled by natural numbers N, as are houses
- elf n visits all houses whose number is a multiple of n
- elf n drops off 10n presents at each house they visit

- so house n gets 10 * sum of divisors of n many presents

which is the first house to get at least 36,000,000 many presents?
i.e. what is the smallest n with sigma(n) >= 3,600,000?


just as a random guess some likely candidates are 2^something (2^22 looks right)
and the smallest product of distinct primes to go over that


desc                n                       sigma(n)
2^21                2097152                  4194303
distinct primes     9699690                 34836480 
4 and distinct      1021020                  4064256


actual answer was 831600 = 2^4 * 3^3 * 5^2 * 7 * 11


part b

elves don't actually want to visit many houses
- each elf will only visit 50 houses
- but they will deliver 11 presents to each house

same question, which is the first house to get at least 36,000,000 presents?



what's the algorithmic approach?
I just kind of faked it using math
also coincidence that I didn't write tests today and I also made mistakes?
turns out the reddit people didn't have a better strat than what I used for part 1; the thing I was missing that many of them did was the simple estimate that at worst case you can bound the list size above by N/10 or N/11
