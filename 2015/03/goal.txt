part a

delivering presents to houses
you get a sequence of directions >, <, ^, v telling you where to go from your current location
after every direction you deliver a present (and also when you're at the origin)

how many houses do you deliver presents to?

strategy: put (x, y) coordinates as keys in a dict and store number of visits as the value


part b

now both santa and robo_santa are delivering presents
santa does the first move, then robo_santa the second, then santa the 3rd and so on
in total how many houses do they visit?
