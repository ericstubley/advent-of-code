part a

the elves are playing a puzzle stealing game
elves 1 through n stand in a circle
at elf k's turn they steal all presents from the elf to their left (k+1, k+2, ...)
if an elf ever has 0 presents they are eliminated

which elf is the one who ends up with all the presents?


part b

the elves change their rules; now they steal from across the circle, breaking ties to the left (so in a 1 2 3 circle elf 1 steals from elf 2)

which elf wins in this case?
(strat here was to use a circularly linked list and keep track of the curr and across the circle pointers)
