part a

you've got more assembunny code, with the additional instruction
out x - transmit x (value of register)

what is the smallest input (a,0,0,0) which will produce 0,1,0,1,0,1,0... forever as output?



the program is basically just printing the binary digits of a + 7*365
so you want the smallest a so that a + 7*365 is 101010101010...
