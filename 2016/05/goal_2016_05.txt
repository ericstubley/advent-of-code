part a

you need to crack the password on a secure door
you uncover the characters of the length 8 password one at a time
- get characters by md5 hashing the door ID followed by an increasing integers index; when the md5 hash starts with five zeroes the next is the next digit of the password

what is the password?


part b

actually it's a bit more involved, there's a second more complicated door
door_id + index gives you the next digit if:
- it starts with five 0s
- the next character [5] is an index 0-7
- the next character [6] is then the password digit at [5]
only use the first index giving a particular digit
