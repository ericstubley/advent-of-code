part a

you have to generate a big string and then compute a checksum
generate the string from an initial s by repeatedly performing
- s + "0" + reversed bitflipped s

compute the checksum by repeatedly doing while length is even
- replace "11" and "00" by "1", "10" and "01" by "0"


what is the checksum if you try to fill a disk of length 272?

part b

what is the checksum if you try to fill a disk of length 01100111101101111?
