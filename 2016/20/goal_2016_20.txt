part a

you're given a list of ranges of integers between 0 and 2^32-1
each represents a list of excluded ranges

what is the first number which isn't excluded

here's the strategy:
sort the ranges by lower bound
then you can union just by checking there's overlap with the next
gonna have a total n log(n) runtime

made a mistake because of merging intervals at integer boundaries: its true that [1, 5] and [6, 9] are disjoint, but they don't miss any integers

part b

how many ips are allowed by the blacklist?
