part a

you're in a maze; only work with nonnegative coordinates, start at (1, 1)
for any cell you can tell if it's a wall or space by
- find x*x + 3*x + 2*x*y + y + y*y
- add the designer's favourite number (puzzle input)
- in binary representation of number find number of 1s; even number of 1s => open, odd => wall

what is the fewest number of steps required to reach 31,39?


part b
