part a

the overall goal of 2016 is recovering the stars that the easter bunny stole
we start by infiltrating the easter bunny's headquarters
we're given confusing direction to get there in the form of "R4, L3, R5" where we turn 90 degrees and then walk a specified amount at each step

what is the actual manhattan metric distance from where we started to where we end?


part b

there's more to it!
the actual location of the easter bunny HQ is the first location you visit twice
this includes the paths overlapping, not just the endpoints

how many blocks away is the first location you visit twice?


got dinged by not breaking out of two loops, not off to a great start
