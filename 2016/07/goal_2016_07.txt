part a

you're given a list of "IP addresses" and you want to know if they support "transport layer snooping"
an IP supports TLS if it has an ABBA pattern, A != B, that is outside of any square brackets, and it doesn't have an ABBA pattern inside any square brackets

how many of the input IPs support TLS? 


part b

you also want to know if the IPs support "super secret listening" (SSL)
the specification here is that there is an ABA pattern (A != B) outside the square brackets and a BAB inside
