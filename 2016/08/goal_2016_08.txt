part a

you need to decipher what is displayed on a fancy screen from only seeing the instructions
screen dimensions are 50 columns x 6 rows
operations are
- rect AxB turn on all pixels starting in the top left in an A wide by B down rectangle
- rotate row y=A by B: move the row A to the right by B pixels, wrapping around
- rotate column x=A by B: same thing but moving column A down by B pixels 

how many pixels are lit after following the instructions?
(this is a good numpy problem)
