part a

you want to drop a ball through a set of spinning discs with holes
if you drop at time t the ball will hit disc n at time t+n
a ball only goes through a disc if that disc is at position 0 when the ball encounters it

so this is just a system of congruences
what is the first time you can press a button to get a capsule?


Disc #1 has 5 positions; at time=0, it is at position 4.
Disc #2 has 2 positions; at time=0, it is at position 1.

want t so that
4 + t + 1 == 0 mod 5
1 + t + 2 == 0 mod 2
together these imply that t should be 
t == 0 mod 5
t == 1 mod 2
i.e.
t == 5 mod 10


for the given input
Disc #1 has 17 positions; at time=0, it is at position 1.
Disc #2 has 7 positions; at time=0, it is at position 0.
Disc #3 has 19 positions; at time=0, it is at position 2.
Disc #4 has 5 positions; at time=0, it is at position 0.
Disc #5 has 3 positions; at time=0, it is at position 0.
Disc #6 has 13 positions; at time=0, it is at position 5.
t + 1 + 1 == 0 mod 17
t + 2 + 0 == 0 mod 7
t + 3 + 1 == 0 mod 19
t + 4 + 0 == 0 mod 5
t + 5 + 3 == 0 mod 3
t + 6 + 5 == 0 mod 13

440895 is the bound


part b

a new (7th) disc has appeared with 11 positions at position 0

same question?



the actual strat that's more efficient than brute force is
just solve the first congruence t + 2 == 0 mod 17 to get t = 15
next is then t = 5 mod 7; add 17 to t (=15) until you get 5 mod 7
repeat, adding lcm (== product bc they're distinct primes) at each new step
