part a

you're given a text file which has been compressed
to decompress, read the file and when you encounter a token like (8x2) take the next 8 characters and repeat them twice, then continue after that


what is the decompressed length of your puzzle input? don't count whitespace


part b

actually you are supposed to use part 2 of the format, where you expand the markers recursively

what is the decompressend length using v2?


I think there's an assumption I should make here that while these rules permit compression of infinite data, you don't actually encounter those situations
something like
(7x3)(15x3)A
will produce an infinite output


so let's assume that when we apply a marker, any submarkers don't try to access past the original chunk
