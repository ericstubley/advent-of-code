part a

you're in a room with trap tiles on the floor
each row of floor tiles is trapped according to the previous row and the following rules
- off the edges count as safe tiles
- row is trapped iff the pattern of tiles above it is ^.., ..^, ^^., .^^
- i.e. the pattern above it is exactly one of the LR tiles

your input is the first row
if there are 40 rows, how many safe tiles are there?


part b

same question but this time 400000 rows


was a bit slower than I wanted, can it be improved?
let's see what happens with a version that does bitarrays instead
hell yeah bitarray version is mega fast
