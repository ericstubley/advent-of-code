part a

there's a bunch of robots running around carrying chips with numbers on them
the bots have two types of instructions
- value X goes to bot Y
- bot Y gives low to A and high to B, where A and B are either bot R or output S

let's assume that each bot appears <= 3 times;
once with instructions on how to give up things, and cumulative twice from getting values or from other bots
with these assumptions each instruction is used at most once
note that the instructions aren't chronological!

what is the number of the bot that is responsible for comparing the value 61 and value 17 microchips?



what is the design that will make this straightforward?
- bot object which supports some operations?
- just an array where we store all the numbers seems simpler
- set of instructions, where we just iterate through and apply all the possible ones
- let's do a little bit of oop practice, even though it is overengineering for this problem its probably actually better longterm
- every relevant bot is mentioned by the handout instructions, so we should by fine
- do we need to prompt the bots to act? I don't think so but let's see what happens
