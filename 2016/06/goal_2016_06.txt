part a

trying to get communications from santa, using a repetition code
the input is a list of words, and message is deciphered by picking the most common letter in each position

what is the message?


part b

actually the way the message is sent is that random noise is chosen
but the characters of the actual message are slightly less likely to appear
so with lots of messages this can be decoded

what is the actual message? this if just flipping a max to a min
