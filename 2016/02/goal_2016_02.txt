part a

you need to use the bathroom before infiltrating the building
rather than a simple code there's instructions to find the code
on a keypad; starting at 5 there's a sequence of U, D, L, R directions
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

ignore instructions that take you off the grid
start from the previous number each time

what is the code?


part b

the keypad is actually
    1
  2 3 4
5 6 7 8 9
  A B C
    D
you still start at 5 and follow instructions the same way
what is the code?
