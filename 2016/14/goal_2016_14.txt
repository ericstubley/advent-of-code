part a

you want to generate some new keys for a one time pad thing
take the md5 of your puzzle input + an integer index
it is a key if
- there's 3 of the same character in a row
- for the first such group of 3 characters, among the next thousand hashes there's five of that character in a row


which index produces the 64th key?


part b

actually you stretch the hashes by rehashing 2016 times when computing them

which index produces the 64th key when you're stretching?
