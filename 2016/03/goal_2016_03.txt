part a

you're given a list of side lengths of things that might be triangles
but some of them violate the triangle inequality! (i.e. sum of shorter two is <= biggest)

how many of the listed triangles are possible?


part b

the triangles are actually listed running down the columns instead of across the rows
same question, how many of the listed triangles are valid?
