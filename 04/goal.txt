part a:
given a bunch of bingo boards with numbers 0-99 (it seems), and a list of numbers called, find the first board to win
actually find the score of the board, which is defined as the sum of the unmarked entries times the entry that made it win
	

part b:
same thing except now you want the last board to one
literally just need to change a min to a max
