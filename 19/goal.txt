part a

you are given a list of scanners and the beacons they detect
each scanner detects beacons in a cube of "radius" 1000 from the scanner, you get the relative position
you don't know the orientation of the scanners, which align to some orientation preserving octahedral symmetry
    this gives 24 different possible alignments for each scanner

if two scanners have 12 common beacons, you can use those to determine the relative positions of the two scanners
    is this a puzzle assertion or a mathematical fact?
    seems like it's a puzzle assertion?

let's start off by treating this more like a data exploration than just writing the solution
one possible idea is to check sets of absolute values of coordinates rather than exact values
    probably the spread of coordinates is big enough that this will work

okay, it looks like the puzzle is well-designed so that when there's overlap there's always either 12 or 6
so with this distances technique you can quickly identify which pairs of scanners have an overlap of 12
let's check whether the resulting graph is a tree or not
    probably is a tree, at least hopefully its connected
        update: not a tree, but does contain every scanner and is connected
    for each pair we can then figure out a relative direction and orientation hopefully
    and then compute the location of every beacon by traversing a spanning tree

okay so here's what we're gonna do
for each edge i - j (with i < j)
    store as edge data the direction vector i to j
    the orientation of j relative to the orientation of i

then for each scanner
    find a path 0 - ... - n
    compose the vectors and orientation to get 0 to n vector, orientation of n relative to 0
    from there compute the positions of the beacons at n relative to 0
    add those to a set

in the end solution is inefficient because you did a lot of recomputing of relative positions
the major time consuming bug today was that matrix multiplication was not the order you expected?   
    in the updating of the total orientation it was like post composition, but actually its precomposition


part b

what is the maximum manhattan distance between any two scanners? (not beacons lol)
