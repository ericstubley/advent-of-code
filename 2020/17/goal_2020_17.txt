part a

you want to help the elves with their fancy Conway Cube energy source
basically its 3d game of life

cubes are either active or inactive points in 3d space
if active and exactly 2 or 3 active neighbours, then active; else inactive
if inactive and exactly 3 neighbours active, then active; else inactive

every cube has 26 neighbours (considering diagonals and straight in 3d space)


after simulating 6 steps how many cubes are active?



part b


lol everything is actually 4 dimn
all the same rules but now with 4 dimns


I'm gonna be lazy and just duplicate the code....
surely this is a good way to do this, but I have other things to do today
decidedly non-optimal solution today, mostly because you didn't do the polymorphism
also the 80 neighbours every time was maybe making it very slow?
somehow even just 6 iterates in 4d was quite slow
