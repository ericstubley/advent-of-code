part a

you get to the hotel, but they're re-laying the tiles and won't let you cross the lobby to check in!
you're given a list of instructions to lay tiles from a reference point

let's use q+r+s = 0 coords

q=0: nw/se (nw = +s/-r)
r=0: w/e (e = +q/-s)
s=0: ne/sw (ne = +q/-r)


how many tiles are set in the end? (they might get toggled back off)


part b

the tiles are in fact a hex grid cellular automaton
a black tile with 0 or more than 2 adjacent black tiles flips to white
a white tile with 2 adjacent black tiles flips to black

after 100 days how many black tiles are there?
