part a

you want to figure out the bus schedule
each bus route's number is also how long it takes the bus to make a full round trip
your input has two lines:
- estimate of the earliest time you could get a bus
- the list of bus routes in service

for whichever bus you can catch earliest, multiply the bus route # by the number of minutes you have to wait for it


(number of minutes to wait for bus n is just -t mod n)


part b

there's a contest to find the times when buses depart with a certain pattern
given 7,13,x,x,59 you want to find the earliest time t such that
- bus 7 departs at time t
- bus 13 departs at time t+1
- bus 59 departs at time t+4


i.e. you want the smallest t such that
t == 0 mod 7
t == -1 mod 13
t == -4 mod 59
CRT to the rescue


what is this smallest timestamp?



how to do CRT
you have the condition (n, a) (soln == a mod n)
you're given the condition (m, b) (soln == b mod m)
and you want to combine

soln will be of the form a + kn; just keep increasing k until you hit == b mod m?
and then new solution is (lcm n m, a+kn)


oof you were to much in math world that you made some dumb mistakes with - signs
but still super fast!
