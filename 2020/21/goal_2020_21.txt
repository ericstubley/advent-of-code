part a

(I feel like you've literally gotten the exact same problem before)
(hypothesis: 2020 was hard on everyone)
you're given a list of ingredients for foods, but unfortunately its in a language you don't understand
each list also has a list of allergens which appear; though not necessarily complete

each allergen occurs in exactly one ingredient

some ingredients you know don't correspond to any allergen; because for each allergen i there exists a food having that allergen and not having that ingredient

how many times do those ingredients appear?


part b

now that you've removed the inert ingredients, you have enough info to find the allergen->ingredient pairing
arrange the remaining ingredients alphabetically by allergen without spaces
submit that


let's be lazy, just do it by hand


("dairy",fromList ["spcqmzfg"])                             -> spcqmzfg
("eggs",fromList ["bltrbvz","dzqlq","rpf","spql","xbdh"])   -> rpf
("fish",fromList ["dzqlq","xbdh"])                          -> dzqlq
("nuts",fromList ["bltzkxx","pflk","spcqmzfg"])             -> pflk
("peanuts",fromList ["bltrbvz","spql"])                     -> bltrbvz
("sesame",fromList ["spql","xbdh"])                         -> xbdh
("shellfish",fromList ["spcqmzfg","spql"])                  -> spql
("wheat",fromList ["bltzkxx","dzqlq"])                      -> bltzkxx



spcqmzfg,rpf,dzqlq,pflk,bltrbvz,xbdh,spql,bltzkxx


that was absolutely a good choice of knowing when to code and when to just do it manually
we're now in the home stretch, no more gaps in the calendar!
