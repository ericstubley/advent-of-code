part a

you want to hack the door/room key card encryption, in order to get into your room

encryption is modular arithmetic based
the door and card each have hidden loop sizes; to encrypt a number they compute
    number ^ (loop size) mod 20201227

you start knowing the public keys of the card and door, which are 7^(loop size)


of course the authentication would bail right at the last day
I think this was the first year where there were absolutely no submission errors!!!


part b : free because it's the last day
