part a

your device runs out of battery mid-flight
fortunately you brought a whole mess of adapters, so let's construct a janky adapter chain to charge it
every adapter produces a certain joltage as output, and can takes joltages 1-3 lower as input
you start with a joltage of 0 from the socket, and your device takes the max of the adapters + 3


in a chain of adapters that uses all of the adapters you have, what is the product of the # of 1-jolt differences and the # of 3-jolt differences


part b

the same rules still apply
how many different adapter chains are possible?


strategies:
- memoized recursive
- divide and conquer
