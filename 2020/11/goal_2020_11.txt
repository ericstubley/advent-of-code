part a

you are sitting in an empty waiting area to board the ferry
the seats fit onto a grid, which you are given
tiles are denoted . for floor, L for empty seat, # for occupied seat

as people arrive they take seats according to a set of cellular automata rules
decisions are based on the number of 8-adjacent occupied seats
- if a seat is empty and there are no occupied neighbours it becomes occupied
- if a seat is occupied and there are 4 or more occupied neighbours it becomes empty
- otherwise remain the same


eventually the seating configuration becomes stable
how many seats are occupied in the stable configuration?


part b

the seating decision is now based on rays in the 8 directions
the 8 pieces of information are the first empty/occupied seat you see when looking in a given direction
also the occupied -> empty rule now takes 5 or more neighbours


little bit hacky hardcoded to make the stencils work but that's okay
also compile times were real slow today?
