part a

you're given a list of rules in a standard expression syntax
and a list of strings (all just using the characters 'a', 'b')

how many of the strings are matched by rule 0?


part b

you have to fix some of the rules
replace rules 8 and 11 by
8: 42 | 42 8
11: 42 31 | 42 11 31


it might be worth looking at which rules always match the same set of values and how those rules (especially rules 42 and 31) are used by rules 8 and 11


fortunately for us, the set of things matched by 42 and the set matched by 31 never overlap in our messages
(maybe they do overlap and we just don't see them, or maybe they don't overlap)
