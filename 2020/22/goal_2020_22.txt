part a

you're on a raft to your vacation destination
you play a card game that is basically war against a crab friend who came aboard

both players play the top card of their deck
the higher card wins, and the winner puts them on the bottom of their deck in decreasing order (higher first)

keep going until one player has all the cards
the score is based on the order; last card is its value x1, 2nd last x2, 3rd last x3 and so on


part b

recursive combat!

if you enter a state you've been in before, player 1 wins
if a deck is empty, other player wins
if you both draw, either
    both have at least as many cards left as the number you drew
        if you drew a, b, play a subgame with (take a) (take b) as your decks
        winner of that subgame is winner of this round
    not, regular combat rules apply


what is the winning deck score?

good job only doing what you need, didn't actually need a memoized recursive combat
also that's gotta be a time record for solving a day 22 problem?
