part a

you're tobogganing down a tree covered hill
the tree pattern repeats to the right because *waves hands* genetics
if you take a path that has a slope coming from right 3, down 1, how many trees do you hit on the way down?

do you load it into an array or just use a map?
let's do the array
i j where i is row and j is column


part b

now test the slopes (1, 1) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1)
find the number of trees hit on each slope and take their product
