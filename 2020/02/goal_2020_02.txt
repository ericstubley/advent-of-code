part a

you're given a list of rules and passwords, and you want to know how many of them are valid
the rule is m n c for ints m, n and character c
pwd is valid if it has between m and n many cs in it


part b

actually the validity rules are different
pwd is valid if it has exactly one c at either position m or n (1-indexed)
