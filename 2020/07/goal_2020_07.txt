part a

there's an arcane list of baggage rules; bags of a certain colour must contain an exact list of other bags

shiny gold bags are at the bottom; they contain no others
so you get a directed graph
how many bag types are below shiny gold in this directed graph?


part b

you want to figure out exactly how impractical it would be to use your shiny gold bag
how many bags will have to be inside it?
