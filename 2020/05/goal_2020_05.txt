you lost your boarding pass! you need to figure out what your seat is
every boarding pass has the row and col encoding in binary basically
7 characters F or B (front or back; F=0, B=1) for the row
3 characters R or L (right or left; R=1, L=0) for the column

the seat id is 8*row + col


what is the highest seat id on a boarding pass?
