part a

you want to hack the inflight entertainment system, which uses the XMAS protocol
it gives you a list of integers
after the first 25 (5 in the test) every number is supposed to be the sum of two of the preceding 25, but never x+x if x appears twice

what is the first number which isn't the sum of two of the preceding ones?


part b

to find the encryption weakness the first step is to find the number as in part a

this number is the sum of a contiguous set of at least two numbers from the original input
add together the smallest and largest numbers in this contiguous set to get the answer



your solution it technically not fully general but it's almost surely gonna work on all these big inputs
