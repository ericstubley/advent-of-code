part a

you want to help the plane fill out their customs forms
there are 26 questions a-z on the form
you get the data in groups; each line is a single person in the group (the questions to which they answer yes)

each group has a score: the number of questions anyone in that group answered yes to
what is the sum of those scores?


part b

you misread the instructions!
you want the count of the questions to which everyone in the group answered yes!
