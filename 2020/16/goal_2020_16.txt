part a 

you want to figure out what the fields on the tickets are
you know what the names of the fields are, and what the ranges for valid values are
but you don't know which numbers on the tickets are which fields

step 1: for all the tickets except yours figure out how many of the fields are not valid for ANY of the possible fields, and take the sum of those values


part b

remove all tickets which have a value that's invalid
the field order between tickets is consistent
use the nearby tickets to figure out what the field order is

then for your ticket, take the 6 fields whose names start with "departure" and multiply your ticket's values together




extract from the tickets a list of (all first elements), (all second elements), etc.
for each of those filter out the list of remaining ranges based on which are valid for that position

whenever we get a position which has a single valid range we add it to the map
restrict the positions and ranges based on the ones we found and repeat


rather than lots of recomputing
build a list of lists (index i is the list of ranges valid for position i)



loooool silly mistake: you computed the list of validTickets and then didn't feed it in :P
other than that it worked first try! good job
