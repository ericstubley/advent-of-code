part a

you're given a list of commands for how to move your ship, to escape the storm!
each command is a letter (N, E, S, W, L, R, F) followed by a number

the cardinal directions move in that direction
L, R turn that many degrees
F moves in whatever direction you're facing


part b

the instructions were on the back of the card all along! you had them wrong
everything is relative to a waypoint, which itself is relative to the ship

N, E, S, W move the waypoint

L, R rotate the waypoint around the ship

F moves the ship by the ship -> waypoint vector

this is an excellent opportunity for complex numbers! Z[i] in fact

turns out making a good Z[i] instance in Haskell is less straightforward than you wanted
but you got something working first try!
there's a LOT of duplicate code here...
