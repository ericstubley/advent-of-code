part a

given a school of fish, each represented by how old they are
after 7 days they reproduce; create a new fish with a timer two days longer and reset this fish to 7
how many fish after 80 days?

this is...just a math problem?
you can compute the function of how many fish a single fish spawns after n days
and then just sum over the given inputs
less thinking required to just write some procedural code to do it (group up same day fish though)

part b

same problem but 256 days instead of 80
thank you python for supporting arbitrarily large ints
