part a

input is a bunch of "navigation subsystem code" which is really just different types of parentheses
everything is made of nested (), [], {}, <>, but there's some syntax errors

find the first illegal character in each line of the input and score according to
): 3
]: 57
}: 1197
>: 25137


part b 

you need to complete the incomplete strings by adding the appropriate parentheses
the stack based approach is good for that

scoring is strange
start with 0, for each character multiply score by 5 and then add point value
): 1
]: 2
}: 3
>: 4

sort these scores and return the middle of that list (guaranteed to be odd number)
