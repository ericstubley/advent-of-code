part a

given a list of line segments as start point, end point you need to find out how many points in the grid (which looks to be 1k square) have at least 2 lines passing through them.
for this part we consider ONLY vertical and horizontal lines

good exercise in OOP
make a line segment class that is iterable
and then just loop over all lines, counting how many pass through each grid point


part b

same problem except now considering all the lines
nice feature that is irrelevant given our setup: all the diagonal lines are at 45 degrees
