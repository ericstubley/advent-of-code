part a

there's a grid of octopi, and you don't want to spook them with your sub lights
you want to use their natural lighting to guide you through

at each step each octopus increases its illumnation by 1
if its > 9 it flashes, and increases all 8 neighbors by 1, then resets to 0 (and is not triggered by further flashes)
keep going until all >9 ones flash

how many flashes have occured after 100 steps?


part b

when is the first step when all octopi flash simultaneously?
mostly the same code, just keep looping until break
