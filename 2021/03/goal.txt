part a
given a list of binary strings compute the product of the gamma and epsilon rates:

gamma rate: a number which in binary has its nth digit the most common nth digit of the input strings
epsilon rate: same deal except least common instead of most


part b
compute the life support rating, which is product of co2 scrubber and oxygen generator ratings

oxygen generator rating: filter out the list until only one element remains
	at the i-th step keep those list elements whose i-th digit is the most common i-th digit
co2 scrubber rating: same except least common digit
