part a

we're given a list of reactor reboot instructions
for now only worry about those within the [-50, 50]^3 box
everything starts at off
each instruction in the reboot steps turns a whole cuboid on or off
how many cubes are on after only the -50 to 50 steps

part b

same problem, just now with the entire instruction set
except now the dimns are way too big to think about storing the whole thing, and also you don't have starting bounds
so instead just keep track of which points (x, y, z) are one as a set

okay doing them one by one seems to very slow also
too slow even on just the first cuboid for this to be reasonable, which makes sense; 10000^3 is very large
other strategies:
- do some cuboid subdivision and keep track of volumes which are on; just count up totals at the end
- there's 420 instructions, so even with cuboid subdivision that's in the the thousands or maybe millions but not too bad
- is there always an axis-aligned separating hyperplane? i.e. can you just check the projections in each dimension
- even so you'd still need to implement subdivision which could be finicky?
- let's try this, good practice

post-mortem
- turns out that implementing the subdivision was not too bad! the cuboid class worked very well
- the downside here is that there's a lot of x, y, z repetition in the cuboid code and in general
