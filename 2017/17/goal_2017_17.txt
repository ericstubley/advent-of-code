part a

insert a bunch of things into a circular data structure
you've got a STEP distance
- start with the list being [0]
- at each t you move forward STEP from the current position, insert t after that position
- do this 2017 times

what is the number after 2017 in the final ordering?


part b

what is the element after 0 at t=50 million?

your queue strat was in fact bad bc you still have to seek within the queue every time...
fine for the small 2017 list, but not for 50 million

but in fact its just a len 50mil for loop with no storage to find the element after 0
