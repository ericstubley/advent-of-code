part a

there's some number of memory banks (4 in test, 16 in prod)
each has an integer number of blocks
at each step take the biggest number of blocks and redistribute (keep adding one as you traverse the list of blocks, loop around)

after how many steps do you revisit a block configuration?


part b

what is the length of the loop?
