part a

breaking past a firewall
there's a bunch of layers, each with a scanner range (this is your input)
the scanner at level x moves back and forth in the given range at each time step (i.e. if the range is 3 it moves between positions 0, 1, 2, 1, 0 in a loop)

let's say you move forward one level at each time step
the severity of getting caught at level x is x * range(x)
there's some rule about the scanners moving onto you or you moving onto the scanners; but i'll set it up so that everything is simultaneous

what is the severity of your whole trip?


part b

you can delay your start time
what is the smallest delay for which you don't get caught?



could do it via a lcm calculation
i.e. you want delay so that for the packet at level x
x + delay % 2(r[x] - 1) != 0
the lcm is apparently 42840, which isn't so big
ah but its not the lcm of the numbers themselves, but of 2x - 2 for each x
so the lcm is actually 563,603,040 
but the computation is still pretty fast
