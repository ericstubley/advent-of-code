part a

you're given a list of particle positions, velocities, accelerations
each time tick you update by:
    add accel to velocity
    add velocity to position

in manhattan distance, which stays closest to the origin in the long term

guess that its whichever has the smallest manhattan value acceleration


part b

destroy particles when they collide

how many particles are left in the long term?



today was a good case of not going big brain to solve these
yes you could try to work out analytically whether things will ever collide again, but you could also just do a reasonable check
in this case testing for no collisions in 1000 timesteps was good enough
