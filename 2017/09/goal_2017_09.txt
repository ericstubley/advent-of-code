part a

you want to cross a stream of characters
the characters are grouped, using {}
each group contains more groups or garbage, separated by commas
garbage is enclosed by <>
within garbage, ! cancels the next character
even if there are thing which look like groups within garbage, they are ignored


groups are assigned scores; 1 more than the group containing it
so the outermost group gets a 1, the next level gets a 2, and so on
what is the total score of all groups in the input?


part b

you're now ready to remove the garbage
you need to count how many characters are removed with the garbage
the leading and trailing <,> don't count, an ! and the thing it cancels don't count

how many characters are removed with the garbage?


automation worked perfectly!
need to do more work to hook it into a good fast system, but the functionality is there
