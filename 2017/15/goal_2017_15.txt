part a

two generators are trying to agree on a sequence of numbers
each generator works by multiplying the current number by a factor, then taking the remainder when you divide by 

2147483647

(which suspiciously is)

2147483648 - 1 = 2**31 - 1

you want to count how many times the generators "agree", where agreement is only in the lowest 16 bits
in particular, count the number of 16 bit matches for the first 40 million numbers
there's just a ton of computation and it's not so clear how to speed it up
other than use a lower level language maybe?


part b

now generator a only yields things which are multiples of 4, generator b multiples of 8

how many matches among the first 5 million now?


realllly curious to hear what reddit has to say about algorithms
uhhhh yeah not much
use pypy if you want faster python, trying that
looooool pypy is so much faster
not even funny


part a: 77.4 vs 1.25
part b: 30.9 vs 1.33
were the speedups that pypy produced
