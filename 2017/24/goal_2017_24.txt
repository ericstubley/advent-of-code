part a

you're given a list of ports, of the form X/Y
you can connect these to make a bridge
X/Y - Y/Z - Z/A
note that order doesn't matter, so X/Y - A/X is a valid connection along the X


the strength of a bridge is the sum of the ports in all the components
X/Y - Y/Z - Z/A has strength
(X+Y) + (Y+Z) + (Z+A)


what is the strongest bridge you can make?

think about it like a graph problem
ports are connected based on matching pins
you want to find a path which doesn't repeat any vertices and which maximizes the sum of the vertices
you have to start with a 0

or is it better to model the different values as the vertices and then edges are the available 0/1
yeah maybe this is better
then the edges have weights
and you want a the maximum weight walk in the graph



maximum walk starting from 0
= max from among edges e out of 0
    weight(e) + max walk starting at v in graph without e

maybe will lend itself to memoized recursive?


part b


first you want to maximize on length, then on strength

what is the strength of the longest bridge you can make?
if there are multiple ones pick the strongest
