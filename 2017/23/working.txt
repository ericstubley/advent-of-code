    sub b -17                   add 17 to b, loop again
jnz 1 -23




the 9 to 32 loop will run 1001 times, since the exit condition is b = c and we're adding 17 to b each time
when does h get increased?
    when we're out of the 11 to 24 loop with flag = 1
    flag gets set to 0 in the 12 to 20 loop when d*e = b
    the inner loops always run 2 to b; think of it like a double for loop
    and you at 0 whenever there's factors

so we're counting primes!
h will be the number of primes in the range [107900, 124900]
ah but we don't check every possible b
only those b of the form 107900 + k*17

so counting primes of the form 17k + 1 in the given range
estimate!
1/17 of (n/log(n))_107900^124900
that gives a guess of ~78

ah be careful! the h += 1 condition is jnz f 2, so we count when f = 0
so in fact we're counting composite things
in which case we should expect 1001-78 = 923
