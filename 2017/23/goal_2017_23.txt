part a

it's another assembly problem!
this time there's 4 instructions

set X Y - set register X to value Y
sub X Y - decrease register X by value Y
mul X Y - set register X to the value register X times value Y
jnz X Y - jump by Y, but only if X is not zero

there's registers a through h, all starting at 0


this sure seems like a manual interpretation problem

how many times does mul get run?
its starting value (79) minus 2, squared


part b

(I totally saw this coming given understanding the program!)
you actually want to run with a = 1 as the starting value

what is the final value of h in that case?
awwww yeeeeee first try by big braining the solution
