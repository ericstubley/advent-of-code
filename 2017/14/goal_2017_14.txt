part a

given a 128 by 128 grid, of bools want to know how many are true
to get bools you need to calculate some knot hashes as in day 10

given a puzzle's key (a string S) you find the bools for row i
- computing the knot hash of S + "-" + "i"
- take those 32 hex digits as 128 binary digits for the 128 entries of the row
- used == true == 1, empty == false == 0

how many squares in the grid are used?


part b

how many regions are in the grid? where a region is 4-adjacent (not 8-adjacent)



code underwent a fair bit of spaghettification today
seems to be much more than should be necessary for the goals of the day
but! still worked quickly on the first try
