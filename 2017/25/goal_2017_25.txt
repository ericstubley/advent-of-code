part a

the Turing machine at the heart of the computer is broken!
you need to rebuild it

this is a list of states, each of which tells you for each of the two possible inputs
- what to write at the current value
- which direction to move
- what state to change to

there's also a diagonstic checksum: you're given a time, and you want to check how many 1s there are on the tape after that many steps

how many 1s are there when the diagnostic checksum happens?


our puzzle input has 12 million + steps, so maybe let's try to understand what our machine is doing?

let's be a little bit clever; our tape will be an int and we'll store the info in its bits

yeah its not the fastest, but also its still pretty darn good for 12 million steps of a turing machine
with pypy its almost instantaneous
