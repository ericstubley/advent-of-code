part a

you're given a list of directions on an infinite hex grid

how far away is the result of the path?


how do you even compute with hex grids?
probably worth figuring out the commutation relations and then simplifying?
even better take a vectors approach
you represent the final vector as a*n + b*nw and then what you want is some distance function
distance is |a|+|b| if same sign, max(|a|, |b|) if different signs or zeros


part b

what is the furthest he ever got away from the origin?


so apparently there's a ton of "standard" ways to do hex grids that the coding people know

the system that you used is referred to as axial coordinates by these resources
