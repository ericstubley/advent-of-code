part a

given a cave system as graph
some of the caves are BIG and some are small
find all the paths from start to end which visit small caves at most once

ideas:
- notice that BIG caves are connected only to small caves
- since every edge connects to a small cave, you want paths start-end which use each edge at most once
- recursive? # of paths start->end = sum over edges start->x of # of paths x->end in G/(x)
- what is the data structure? just use a library! better to learn libraries than reinvent the wheel

part b

you actually have time to visit a single small cave twice
start and end can only be visited once
this should be straightforward to modify part a: add an attribute to the vertices

the solution was much slower than I expected!
the recursion must be trying a whole bunch of dud pathways
