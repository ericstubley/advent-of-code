Advent of Code 2021 solutions

My repo for storing my solutions for the 2021 Advent of Code: https://adventofcode.com/2021

Nothing special about these solutions. I expect that most of them will not be prettified once I get the answer, so read at your own risk. I'm exploring using various programming tools as relevant, for example on day 5 I learned about making python objects iterable for a clean approach to the problem. If for some reason anyone ever looks at this and wants to chat about the solutions, don't hesitate to reach out! ericdavidstubley@gmail.com is the best place to reach me.

Each problem gets its own folder labelled 01-25.
Within each folder there is at least
- `goals.txt`: my short notes about what the problem is asking for
- `input.txt`: the problem input
- `XYa.py` and `XYb.py`: python files solving part a and part b. part b is very often turning out to be almost entirely a copy of part a
