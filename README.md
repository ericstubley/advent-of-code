Advent of Code 2021 solutions

My repo for storing my solutions for the 2021 Advent of Code: https://adventofcode.com/2021

Nothing special about these solutions. I expect that most of them will not be prettified once I get the answer, so read at your own risk. I'm exploring using various programming tools as relevant, for example on day 5 I learned about making python objects iterable for a clean approach to the problem. If for some reason anyone ever looks at this and wants to chat about the solutions, don't hesitate to reach out! ericdavidstubley@gmail.com is the best place to reach me.
