part a

you're given assignments in the form

a-b,c-d where a, b, c, d are natural numbers

assignments inidicate sections of the jungle the elves have to clean out
sections might overlap

how many of the pairs have one fully contained in the other? (equal on one or both sides counts as contained)


part b

how many of the assignment pairs overlap at all?


from reddit?
the cleaner way to write comparisons are

   a <= c <= d <= b
or c <= a <= b <= d

for containment (the middle ones are automatic)


max(a, c) <= min(b, d)

vs my choice of
a <= d and c <= b (accomplishes the same comparison with 2 rather than 3!)
