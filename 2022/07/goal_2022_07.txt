part a

you have the output from a bunch of cd and ls commands exploring a directory tree
each directory has a total size: the size of all files plus subdirectories

what is the sum of the directory sizes of those directories with size < 100000 


part b


total system size is 70000000 (70 million), you need at least 30000000 (30 million) of empty space
you need to pick one directory to delete which will leave enough room for the update
what is the size of the smallest directory you can delete which will free up enough space?



so today parsing gave you a real hard time
but you learned about sepEndBy! that should make future parsing more straightfoward

also you did a good job of re-writing things in a cleaner point-free style as you thought it through


one thing you could have done is to have the parsing directly compute sizes?
although that probably decreases readability
and actually not so clear how it would work
all in all you made good choices
