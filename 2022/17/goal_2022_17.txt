part a

there's falling rocks in a predictable sequence, moved left and right while falling by a predictable sequences of blasts of air
the chamber is 7 units wide and infinitely tall
each rock starts so that its left edge is 2 units away from the wall, and its bottom edge is 3 units away from the floor/highest rock

after 2022 rocks have fallen, what is the height of the rock tower?


this is a job for the state monad, with state = chamber, blocks, gas



part b

how tall will the tower be after 1000000000000 rocks have fallen?


lcm of 5 and length jets is the repeating height

test_input has length 40
input has length 

alas, a non-constant number of jets is used per rock
so our actual strategy will be to insert a flag jet at the end of the cycle
and we check after we have successfully dropped a thing




okay maybe key off of the current rock and the jet index
