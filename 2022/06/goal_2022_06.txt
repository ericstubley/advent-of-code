part a

you have a communication device that needs to find the actual start in a datastream

you need to find the index of the place in the datastream after the first occurrence of 4 distinct characters in a row


part b

14 instead of 4


let's write out a more general version
(Eq a) => [a] -> Int -> Int
is it worth making the algorithm that is smarter than just nub?
what is that algorithm?
    if you come across a conflict, remove characters until you remove the duplicate
    then add characters back on until you hit the required length


so really the good algorithm is to just build the longest distinct string until you have a length at least n
do this with a sequence and a set
it'll be good practice
even though nub is fast
