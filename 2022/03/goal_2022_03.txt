part a

you're given a list of bags packed improperly
each bag is a string of alpha characters
the first half and second half have exactly one character in common
each char has a priority; 1-26 for a-z, 27-52 for A-Z

what is the sum of the priorities of the overlap characters?


part b

each group of three elves has a common badge
their only item in common

what is the sum of the priorities of the badges?



the internet points out the following clever thing
the list of objects that can appear in a bag is bounded (52 = 2*26 of them)
so rather than building sets you can build a bitmask (in 64 bit ints say)
and then logical and is the set intersection
