part a

it's a shortest path search in a grid
you're given a start and an end spot
you can only move to grid squares whose elevation is at most 1 higher


what's the search algorithm?
store a set of visited places, a queue of places to visit along with distances


reader monad to store the grid, start, end spots



part b

now this time start from any place labelled a
what is the shortest path?

the strategy here is to just search outwards from the END rather than the start
and we change the termination condition of the search, from hitting the actual start to hitting anything of height 0


430 is the second part answer
