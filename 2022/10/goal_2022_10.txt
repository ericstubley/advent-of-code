part a

you want to design a new screen for your very simple computer
there's only two instructions NOOP and ADDX int, for the single register X which starts at 1
noop just does nothing for a cycle
addx takes 2 cycles to do the adding


you want to consider the sum of the signal strengths for those cycles which are 20 mod 40 (20, 60, 100, etc)
signal strength is register * cycle number

what is the sum of those signal strengths?


part b

the register x tells you the middle position of a 3-wide sprite
the crt screen is 40 pixels wide by 6 high
the cpu draws a pixel each cycle; so cycles 1 through 240 correspond to pixels 0 through 39 for 6 rows
if the sprite is positioned so that one of its 3 pixels is the current pixel being drawn, then that pixel is lit; otherwise its unlit
