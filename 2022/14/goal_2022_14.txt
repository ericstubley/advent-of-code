part a

this is a callback to 2018 day 17
you're in a cave with sand falling from the ceiling through some rock obstructions
the rocks are given by paths i1,j1 -> i2,j2 -> i3,j3 -> ... -> in,jn

sand falls starting from 500,0
- fall down 1 tile i,j -> i,(j+1)
- if that's blocked by sand or rock, try i,j -> (i-1),(j+1)
- if that's blocked by sand or rock, try i,j -> (i+1),(j+1)
- if that's blocked by sand or rock rest
- if you go below the lowest rock you fall off the screen


how many units of sand come to rest?


part b

in fact there's a floor!
its infinitely long, and two units lower than the lowest rock


huh, wrote up a thing which passes the tests, but it is maximum slow??
I think it's just an immutable maps things
let's try to speed it up

answers are 672, 26831
smarter rewrite made it fast, yay!
