part a

there's a bunch of elves on the grid
they diffuse according to the following rules
- step 1: everyone proposes a move. if they have no 8-neighbours they stay put
    if the north 3-neighbours are empty, propose north
    south
    west
    east
- step 2: follow the proposed moves if they don't lead to conflict, don't move if they do lead to conflict 


the list of proposed directions rotates every round: so in round 2 they first try south, in round 3 west, in round 4 east


part b

how many rounds until they stabilize?
