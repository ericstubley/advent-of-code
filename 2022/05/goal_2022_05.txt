part a

you're given a grid with stacks of crates, along with a list of instructions for how much to move between piles
when moving between piles the crates get moved one at a time, so orders get reversed

when you follow the given instructions, which crates do you end up with on top of the piles?


part b

the crane is a crate mover 9001, which means it can pick up multiple crates
so rather than rearranging one at a time it just picks up the whole stack

when you follow the instructions this way, which end up on top?



...as predicted parsing was the hardest part
