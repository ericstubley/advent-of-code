part a

the monkeys give you a board to input the password on, and a list of directions
there's an extraction method for the final cell (1000*x + 4*y + (0-3) depending on direction)
what is that extracted value?


part b

the map is actually a net of a cube, rather than a more complicated surface
so the only thing that needs to change is the rules for coordAhead


how to handle this?
can get side length?


manually define a map for coordAhead?
since you know the grid size, you know the boundaries of the six faces

if interior, you know how to compute
if edge, it matches with some other edge
24 cases to write down, not so bad???
14 cases if you just handle the edges... still bad


you can compute some edge matchings just by checking for the nearest left and right 90 degree rotations
- nothing ever has both
- if you have neither what to do?
- if you have a straight line neighbouring edge
- "straightening out" the edges looks like it works in general???



as a general strategy you're not actually gonna do
identify the blocks
taking a block, shifting it, and rotating it 90 degrees does the job
you can probably figure out which blocks have to be adjacent, by transitivity

130388 is too high



all in all not a good solution
in particular it doesn't produce the correct answers for both parts without commenting/uncommenting
