part a

there's falling lava, you scan a droplet
the scan approximates it as a bunch of 1x1x1 cubes in a 3d space
compute the surface area by counting the number of visible faces


part b

you also counted interior surface area!
just count the exterior surface area, what is this?

exterior surface area = total surface area - interior surface area
there's only 20^3 = 8000 total coords


strategy:
start filling in from (0, 0, 0), adding a queue of all adjacent things not currently in the map
