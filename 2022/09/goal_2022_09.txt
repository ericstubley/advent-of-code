part a

rope simulator 9000
you're given a sequence of instructions for how the head of the rope moves (by some RLDU commands)
moving one space at a time, the head of the rope moves in a 2d grid
the tail catches up, but only when the head is sufficiently far away (2 in a single direction or a knight move); moves so that it is diagonal or right beside 

how many positions does the tail occupy over the course of the movement?


part b

now the rope has many knots, each consecutive pair following the rules as before
if the rope has 10 knots (rather than 2) how many positions does the tail occupy?


did a real good job using haskell powers to take the existing functions and work up a fast solution to part b
