the monkeys are back!
they are yelling numbers or operations

what does the monkey named root yell?


part b

root's operation is actually equals
humn is you, not a monkey

what number should you yell so that root gets two equal numbers?



target = op a b


want to find either
+ a = target - b    b = target - a
- a = target + b    b = a - target
* a = target / b    b = target / a
/ a = target * b    b = a / target
