you get a list of numbers written in base 5 with representatives -2 (=), -1 (-), 0, 1, 2; you need to compute their sum and return it in that same format


could just operate with strings, converting them to ints and then back
could define a data type for digits and then num instance on [digit]


can we just operate directly with strings?

(+): the carry is at most +-1, and then add up the digits
