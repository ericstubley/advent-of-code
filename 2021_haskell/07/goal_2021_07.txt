part a

there's a bunch of crabs submarines to line up, moving horizontally costs 1 fuel per unit
the median is where you want to place them (either median if there's 2) since moving off the median increases in both directions and the function is locally linear


part b

now the cost is quadratic (1, 1+2, 1+2+3,...)
the mean is now the best choice
there's a nice calculus proof
