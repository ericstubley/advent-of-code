part a

there's a bunch of lanternfish, each with an internal timer
timer decreases by 1 each day
if a lanternfish starts the day with a timer of 0, it resets its timer to 6 and spawns a new lanternfish with timer 8

how many after 80 days?

part b

how many after 256 days?



johan hidding's solution is great because it really lets you follow the strategy of write out the rules and let the data structure take care of the rest
- can you combine the vector strategy with this tally strategy?
- where pure n = e_n?
