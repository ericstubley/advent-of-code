part a

given the integer grid, find the path from top left to bottom right which minimizes risk
can only move r,l,u,d
entering a grid spot increases risk by the amount listed on that spot

one solution:
- build the directed graph with nodes as edges, all the edges, edges weight into something all the risk
- run dijkstra


part b

the same idea but actually the grid is larger
take your existing grid and repeat it 5 times in each direction, adding one at each repeat
when you get past 9 wrap around to 1
so if you started 1x1 you'd get

12345
23456
34567
45678
56789

post-mortem
- in the end this was slower than I wanted?
- is there any puzzle structure you can exploit
- or maybe a more tailored shortest path finder because of clear grid structure
