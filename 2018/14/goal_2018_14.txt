part a

the elves are trying to cook up the best possible hot chocolate recipe using their plants
as they make more recipes they get added to a scoreboard
- take the sum of the current two scores; add the one or two digits (tens digit first) to the scoreboard
- advance each of the current pointers by 1 + their score

what are the ten scores after the number of recipes in the puzzle input?


part b

actually you interpreted the elves plan backwards
when your puzzle input appears as a sequence of scores, how many recipes are to the left of it?


same strat, just now check the tail end of the scoreboard for a match


good use of a new data structure and clean imports
