part a

your time travel watch has some fuel issues
the fuel cells are layed out on a grid (300x300), and you want to select the 3x3 region with the highest total power level
the fuel cell at X, Y has power level given by some function of X, Y + the grid serial number

what are the (top left) X, Y coordinates of the region with the highest power level?


this looks like a grid problem, but at least the setup for part a is such that its really just a big computation
there's no actual grid locality, so let's set it up without an actual grid


part b

what if you allow the 3 in 3x3 to vary?
I'm just trying the brute force approach and its slow but it works and is simple

let's try a more memory intensive version
create a Map ((x, y), region) -> regionSum
can be a bit smart in making it to avoid tons of computation i.e. O(n) to compute nxn region




welp
you goofed it
summed area rectangles: build a grid where x, y entry is sum of all entries above and to the left
so to get any area sum you can just take a difference of two elements
that would make things much better
