part a

to save the reindeer you need to open a portal to get some hot chocolate; doing this requires aligning with some constellations

you're given a list of spacetime locations (i.e. 4 tuples)
two points are in the same constellation if they're manhattan distance <= 3
and then these chain together to join up constellations

how many constellations are there in the given points?


part b for free bc day 25

did you actually gain anything from using sets?
set unions say that they're better than O(n+m)? doesn't really make since if we have to reconstruct the whole thing with O(n+m) elements...

if it was lists of lists of stars
we can short circuit on the near computations
joining is just concat
yeah really not convinced that the sets did anything, but hard to tell with this size of input
