part a

you're given a big 1000x1000 rectangle fabric that the elves need to cut
each elf thinks you need to cut a different rectangle out of it, given by matrix top left corner coordinate + size

how many square inches are within two or more elf claims?


here's the issue I'm having: lack of mutable data structures
if you had a mutable grid, you could just O(small rectangle) update it with each rectangle
but because you have to make a full copy this'll be O(total covered area) at each of the 1411 rectangles

options:
- make a Data.Massiv.Array and just create new versions of it with each update?
- make a Data.Map that stores counts of the non-zero ones
- make it so that updating past two doesn't require reconstruction?



part b

exactly one elf's claim to fabric real estate has no overlap with other claims
what is the id of that claim?




good job sticking with the parsing
things felt real good in solving out the problem on the backend
parsing this way is real nice once you get the hang of it
