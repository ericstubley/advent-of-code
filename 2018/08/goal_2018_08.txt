each node is a header: the number of children, then the number of metadata entries

so A has two children (B and C) and 3 metadata entries (1, 1, 2)


2 3 0 3 10 11 12 1 1 0 1 99 2 1 1 2
A----------------------------------
    B----------- C-----------
                     D-----


what is the sum of all the metadata entries?


part b

what's really going on is that you want to extract the value from each node
if a node has no children, its value is just the some of its metadata entries

if a node has children its value is the sum of the children referred to by the metadata entries
1 refers to the first child, 2 to the second and so on
metadata of 0 or larger than number of children means nothing

so here in this example
D: has value 99
C: has value 0
B: has value 33
A: has value B + B + C = 66
