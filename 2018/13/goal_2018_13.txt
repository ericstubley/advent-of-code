part a

you're given a big grid of train tracks which intersect
the elves put some carts on them
there's rules governing the cart movement
- they take turns advancing starting from the top and leftmost within a row
- they advance on square at a time
- if they hit an intersection they cycle between turn left, straight, turn right

what is the location (x, y) for the first collision?


part b

what is the location of the last cart standing (after the tick on which it becomes the last)?



today was a very good instance of using the right data structures
- cyclic enums
- figured out more of how to use the grid
