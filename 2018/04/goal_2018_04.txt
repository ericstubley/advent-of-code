part a

you're given a very scrambled list of data about when guards are on duty, and when they wake up and fall asleep

you want to know when a guard is most likely to be asleep

a := find the id of the guard who sleeps the most minutes total
b := find the minute (00-59) where that guard is asleep most often

what is a * b


something went fishy with the parsing; you fixed it but you're not sure why the fix worked
- initially tried to parse a | b | c, where each included parsing the time
- this would only parse a successfully, and fail on b or c
- but split out parsing the time, and then parse smaller bits of a | b | c
- this worked
- perhaps the following chain of events
    try to parse a, the first step of which is parsing a time
    this consumes the parsed time, and then fails at a later step
    when it goes to parse b it tries to again parse a time
    but the time has been consumed, so it fails


part b

second strategy

of all the guards, which guard is the most asleep on a given minute?
that is for each guard find the total numbers of times asleep per minute
pick the guard who has the highest single total in those

again product of minute and guard id




really hit the struggle bus today
but you still learned things
and got it done!
on top of interview stress!!
