part a

you have to help the elves from year 1018 build the sleigh
there's a list of instruction dependencies, and you have to do them in order
when there's multiple options available take the lowest alphabetically

what is the order you perform the steps in?


this is just topological sorting
- graph operations
    - get all vertices which have no incoming edges
    - get all incoming edges to v
    - get all outgoing edges from v


part b

topological sort with some timing
you now have five workers
each step takes 60 seconds + some char distance (A is 61, B is 62, ...)

single heap of size @ most # of workers
- find as many available workers as possible, add to heap
- subtract min time from all heap times, add to total time taken
- pop off all zeroes from heap
