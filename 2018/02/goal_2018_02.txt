part a

you're given a list of warehouse box ids
current challenge is just to compute a checksum
of the list you want the product of 
- the number which have a letter occurring exactly twice
- the number which have a letter occurring exactly thrice

what is that checksum?


part b

there's a pair of ids which differ by exactly one character
identify that pair, and the answer is that string with the common letter removed.



there's a bug in the automated submission code
strings are shown and so get extra quotes around them which causes bad submission
