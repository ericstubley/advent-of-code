part a

you want to help the elves build from the forest
it's a 3-state cellular automaton open (.) trees (|) lumber (#) where
- . -> | if there are 3 or more adjacent |
- | -> # if there are 3 or more adjacent #
- # -> # if there is at least 1 | and at least 1 #, else .


all the updating happens simultaneously so it's just a map with a stencil

you want the resource value (number of trees * number of lumber)

what is the resource value after 10 minutes?


part b

what is the resource value after 1000000000 minutes?

reasonable way to do it is to find the grid repeat period
even though there's 3^(50^2) possible grids the rules make things group up so we actually do hit a repeat
