part a

you're given a list of grid coordinates
every actually lives in an infinite grid
for each given grid point there's a zone around it of the points which are (manhattan) closer to it than any other
some of these may be infinite

of the grid points with finite zones, what is the size of the largest zone?


- parse input
- identify the boundaries
- identify the point which lie on the boundary
- identify which marked points will have finite areas (is it just closest point on boundary?)
- for each square within the boundary, identify which point its closest to
- take the one with the largest area

list of grid points is small enough that you should just map manhattan over the whole list of grid points and select the minimum



part b


now we care about the total distance from a grid point to the given points

what is the size of the region which contains all points which have total distance < 10,000?


the real question here: can exterior points have this property?
distance to boundary == x => 50*x total distance compared to the closest boundary point
so first let's figure out the maximum total distance on the boundary





I feel like that was a ton of code for something that shouldn't have taken that much...
but today was good because things just worked right away
