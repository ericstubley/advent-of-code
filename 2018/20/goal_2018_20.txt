part a

the elves constructed a base!
but instead of giving you a map, they gave you a regex containing directions to every room
by traversing the rooms according to this regex you can visit the entire base and build up a map of it

what is the furthest shortest distance to a room? i.e. if you compute the shortest path from the start to each of the rooms, which is furthest?



there's a few parts to this challenge?
- parse the regex into a useful form (maybe that form is a string)
- traverse the regex and build up a graph, in the form of a Map Ix2 (4-tuple of tiles?)
- do a bfs with queue to find distances
- printing out the grid could be kind of annoying in this format
- let's do it by encoding door state into a 4 bit int


part b

how many rooms in this place have a shortest path from your current location that passes through at least 1000 doors?



didn't do so hot on readability today, but some nice things
- good reusing code for bfs and grid printing
- knew what to do for the monadic modification (>> to print an extra line)
- solution is wicked fast
