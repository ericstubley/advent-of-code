part a

you're in an underground cavern where the elves are trying to grow plants
it's a 1d cellular automaton with rules based on 2 neighbours out
the initial state is given as pots labelled 0 to the right
as new pots get plants in them they might start being negatively numbered

after 20 generations, what is the sum of the indices where plants exist?


let's store the rules and pots in maps



part b

after 50 billion generations what is the index sum of the pots which contain plants?
let's just figure out the rules and evolve manually to find it?

hangon let's just try first to evolve, but only tracking the indices where plants exist
hangonhangon that's not quite going to work, since we need to consider both the places where plants exist and every space within two of where plants exist


made some reasonable assumptions about the growth and it checked out!
good job figuring out what was going on without figuring out what was going on
