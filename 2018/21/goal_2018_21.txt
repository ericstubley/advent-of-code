part a

we're back to time assembly
here's a program that does some input checking before possibly entering an infinite loop
you can change the starting value of register 0 but all others start at 0

What is the lowest non-negative integer value for register 0 that causes the program to halt after executing the fewest instructions?
this reads a bit ambiguous but I'm taking it to mean: the min of the set of non-negative integers which cause the minimal stopping time


part b


what is the lowest non-negative integer which causes the program to halt after executing the most instructions?


solution was to generate the (infinite) list of all r3s that hit that final condition
chop this off at the first time there's a recurrence and take the last element
