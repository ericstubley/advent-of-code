part a

you're given a very polymer built out of units, represented as letters
the letter itself represents unit type, the capitalization reflects polarization
units of the same type but opposite polarizations reacts and annihilate
units of different types don't interact


part b

one of the unit types is causing problems, preventing as much reaction as possible
what is the length of the smallest polymer that gets produced by removing a single unit type?




solution is slow because it needs to fully traverse the list at each iteration; the list is 50000 at potentially you need to traverse it 50000-final length / 2 many times, because the worst case is only a single compression gets made


here's the algorithm maybe:
- split the list in two
- recursively run this procedure on both
- reverse the initial segment
- chop off matching from the heads of both
- rejoin

yes that is mega fast hurry
