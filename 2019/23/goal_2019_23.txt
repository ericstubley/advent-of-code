part a

finally an intcode problem involving a whole big network
initialize 50 copies of the machine with inputs (their addresses) 0-49

they'll run and produce outputs in groups of 3 (an address, an x, a y)
when they request input if there's any queued up for their address you give them the x and then the y; if not give them a -1

eventually one of them will send something to address 255; what is the y value?



I think altSink is what you need
everything is running in a state monad

the source is a global queue
yields Packets
    a Packet is either just an EmptyPacket Int or Packet Int Int Int

you want to altSink together a bunch of pipes
each pipe is 

preprocessor
    input type is Packet
    output type is Int
    upstream type irrelevant
    return type ()

    this will yield the id
    and then go into a loop of awaiting packets, sending -1 if empty or the x y if nonempty

the actual VM
    input type Int
    output type Int
    upstream type irrelevant
    return type Program

    just does its thing

the postprocessor
    input type Int
    output type Void
    upstream type Program
    return type Int

    takes three outputs and puts them into the queue



uhhhh wow that worked first try


part b

packets sent to 255 are stored in the NAT
the NAT only stores one packet at a time
when the input queue is empty, the controller sends the packet in the NAT to address 0


what is the first y value delivered twice in a row by the nat?
