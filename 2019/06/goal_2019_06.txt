part a

you're given a directed graph (really a tree) of orbit information; everything directly orbits something else, and thereby indirectly orbits things

what is the total sum of direct + indirect orbits?



what's the best way to represent things?
you want to avoid recomputing depths many times over

build a orbiter -> orbitee map
make the naive depth function


part b

you want to move from where YOU are to where SANta is
how many orbit changes are necessary?


the idea is to use a set
the number of transfers is the size of the symmetric difference of the two paths to the center
