part a

you've got to rescue all the little bots that are trapped outside during the solar flare, using your rescue bot
you have an intcode program that uses ascii for IO

the program prints a track of where the bot has traveled
for each intersection in the track, its alignment parameter is the product of its x (from the left) and y (from the top) coordinates

what is the sum of the alignment parameters of the track?


could hack it with a map but let's practice using massiv stencils
the strat
    get the output as a string
    lines it
    massiv it to an Array2 Char
    apply a stencil which sends non intersections to 0 and intersections to the alignment parameter
    sum the resulting array


part b

you need to supply the movement commands to the bot
you give to L, R, or a number and it does that movement (turn or forward n)

because of bot memory limitations you can't give it more than 20 chars at a time (excluding newlines)
but thankfully you can split the movement up into 3 subroutines
so you give it a main subroutine (like A,B,C,B,A,A)
then each of A, B, C
then a y or n to tell it to display video
it will output a single int (not char!) that says how much space dust it collected

move the bot across the whole track; what is the space dust at the end?



let's talk strategy
    there are 13 intersections
    which gives 2^13 = 8192 possible tracks; assuming we don't split in the middle of a straight line
    if we did that how could we identify the splitting into A,B,C?
    the track has length 319, on the order of 42 turns
        nope in fact its 319 + 13 = 332 because of the intersections

    maybe we can design the track by hand?
    R,8,L,8,L,8,L,8,R takes us around a square, end with opposite 
    6,2 is a common pattern

just found it manually!
    broke it up into obvious pieces
    then looked for patterns in the string of A,B,C,D
    could group up AB and DA which reduced size enough to fit into memory


how to find it non-manually:
    build the list of turn, max move that you found manually
    do list monad magic on all prefixes to try that as A (and then sim for B, C)
    a <- tail $ inits path is the monad thing that iterates over all non-empty prefixes of the path
    the guard is the monadic function which will discard the bad choices (i.e. length > 20, trying to use A inside B,...)
    people used show and showList to correctly format the list of commands so you can easily check for length <= 20
