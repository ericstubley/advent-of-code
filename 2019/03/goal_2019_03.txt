part a

you're given a description of two wires on a grid
description is of the form R20,U5,D17,L54,...


the wires intersect at several points
what is the (manhattan) distance to the origin of the closest intersection point?


strategy:
- convert wire as list to a set of points
- intersect the sets
- find min by manhattan distance (or maybe 2nd min bc both have the origin)

let's represent points with Ix2 from Massiv? really no different from tuples though
stick to tuples to save importing


part b

each wire takes a certain number of steps to reach an intersection
the sum of the steps to an intersection is the signal delay
if a wire hits a point several times because of self intersections, take the steps for the first hit

what number of steps is necessary to reach the intersection with minimal signal delay?


the strat here is to use a map point -> dist instead of just a set of points
