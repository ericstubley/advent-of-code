part a

you're given a maze, but there's portals in it
what is the length of the shortest path AA to ZZ


part b

in fact the puzzle is a recursive space
the outer level of portals connects to a bigger version of the maze, the inner level to a smaller version

you start at level 0; the only working outer portals are AA and ZZ, all the inner portals work

what is the shortest path AA level 0 to ZZ level 0?
