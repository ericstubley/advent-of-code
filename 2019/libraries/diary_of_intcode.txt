Day 02: add, mul, hlt
    original implementation; pure with vectors
Day 05: ipt, opt, positional and immediate modes in part a; jnz, jez, clt, ceq in part b
    IO monad with mutable vectors
Day 07: strictly speaking nothing necessarily new internally, this is the feedback loop problem
    VMInterface with immutable vectors
Day 09: rbo and relative mode in general
    VMInterface with immutable intmaps
Day 11: paint the hull with the robot
    Eventually got the conduino working, but it was a nightmare
Day 13: play breakout through intcode
    Hooked up the conduino in remarkably short order
    Would have been nice to figure out the score computation by "pure thought"; figure out the program
    Some of the reddit suggestions were things like: always move the paddle under the ball
    Would have been nice to write an AI to play the game 
    Need to have a clearer outline of the transformer stack you're using
Day 15: repair the oxygen tank with the repair droid
    Introduced Ascii IO 
    Both parts were BFS (part a was shortest start -> tank, part b was longest shortest path tank -> anywhere)
Day 17: move the bot around the scaffold in an optimal way
    Cleaned up the interfaces and exports, hopefully we're in final form now
    Part B was the meat, about finding an optimal compression of the path
    Solved part B by hand :P
Day 19: test out the tractor beam
    This was very straightfoward!
    Involved making many many small calls to the tractor beam boolean intcode
Day 21: run the hull scanning springdroid
    solved both parts by hand :P:P:P
    the challenge here was circuit design
    in a constrained space fit a circuit which obeys some rules
    again nothing really special about the intcode itself
Day 23: rebuild the network of 50 machines after the cat6 disaster
    you did some pipe magic by using the Alternative instance of sinks
    tbh you wrote it and it worked first try, but it seems a bit black magic
    redesigned things a bit to get part 2 working
    key insight was to separate out the running of the network from the packet snooping


Plans for the future
- have thought about having a mutable map instance, but unclear if that's necssary
    keep this in your back pocket
- debug mode, where you can get a record of all 
- interactive mode
- error instance for all the possible errors?
    trying to access negative parts of memory
    can't parse op
    can't parse mode
    ran out of input
- once we're in a relatively settled state go back and update all the puzzles to work with that
- maybe the way to frame it is
    selectOp >>= performOp >>= updateState
    to separate out when various things happen; though that is disingenuous because reading updates the state
- the exit modes thing is a bit jank
- reorganize the intcode file; maybe split it up into several
- not actually a good idea from readability, but keep the iptr and base in -1 and -2 of the map...
- at one point you had the idea to prettyprint as just another interface
    probably not actually a good idea because you really want to redefine the instructions, not the interface 
    also prettyprinting is not so well defined an operation
    and you wanted to avoid hardcoding the width of the instructions in several places, which this could very well require
- fix up the export list; this probably requires better control flow tools to export
- type synonyms for the monad stack


What do you think you're gonna need?
- speed to run slow programs
- tools to help in meta-analysis of impossible runtime programs
    this!
    figuring out what the day 13 computer was doing to compute scores would have been great
- more versatile types of input/output, i.e. pipes?
    conduino is the simple version of conduit? do some research
- define a cluster? for doing things like feedback loops
- just more control flow tools probably?
