part a

get the air conditioner working by upgrading your intcode computer
you'll need to add two new instructions
- input x
- output x

and support for parameter modes
- single digit that's part of the input
- parameter 0 means position mode: int at iptr + i indicates the index in the program of the value to use
- parameter 1 means immediate mode: int at iptr + i indicates the value to use
- first parameter's mode is in hundred's digit, second in thousands, etc.
- parameters that an instruction writes to will never be in immediate mode


part b

4 new opcodes! note that values use parameter modes
- jump-if-true x y: if x is non-zero then set iptr to value of y
- jump-if-false x y: if x is zero then set iptr to value of y
- less than x y z: if x < y store 1 at index z else 0
- equals x y z: if x < y store 1 at index z else 0


new rule: if an instruction changes the instruction pointer, just use that rather than increasing by the width of the operation
