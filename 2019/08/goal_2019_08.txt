part a

the elves sent you an image of the password for the mars rover, but it's a terrible format
the format is a single string of digits
its a series of layers, each layer having the same size
so a 3x2 image with 2 layers would have AAABBBCCCDDD where A is row1layer1, B is row2layer2, C is row1layer2, D is row2layer2


your image is 25 wide by 6 tall
find the layer with the fewest 0 digits
in that layer what is the product of # of 1s vs # of 2s


part b

now you need to decode the image
you stack up the layers
0 is black, 1 is white, 2 is transparent


this is just a foldl over layers with a zip to stack two layers
