part a

you need to repair your oxygen tank using the repair droid
you can issue commands 1 (North) 2 (South) 3 (West) 4 (East) to the droid
the drop will respond with a 0 (hit a wall) 1 (moved) 2 (moved onto the tank)
any other input will exit immediately

what is the fewest number of movement commands required to move the droid to the oxygen tank?

strategy:
state monad input and output pipes
track the droid's path with a stack

oh and then you had to write a shortest path finder; probably could do much more elegant but could write this fast at least


part b

how long does it take oxygen to fill the maze? i.e. what is the longest path starting at the tank?
