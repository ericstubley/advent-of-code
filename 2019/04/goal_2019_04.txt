part a

the elves lost the password for the venus fuel depot
they only remember some features about it
- it is a 6 digit number
- it is within the range given in the puzzle input
- two adjacent digits are the same
- going from left to right, the digits never decrease (112233 is good, 431567 is bad)


how many passwords meeting these criteria are there?
piece of cake with filters


part b

slightly more subtle rule
- the matching digits are not part of a larger set of matching digits

same question but with this new rule
