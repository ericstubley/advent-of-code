part a

you need an emergency hull painting robot; the elves sent you the intcode program it runs
the robot has a camera which is where the input comes from; 0 if its on a black plates, 1 if white
for each input the robot will give two outputs; a colour, and a turn value (0 for left, 1 for right)
the robot always advances forward by 1 after turning

the robot starts facing up


this is a job for a state monad
we'll set up camera and paintAndMove pipes to connect to an execute
think through the laziness/order of operations
????
clearly you don't understand the conduits that well
and we need to work on getting that better 
do something with simple conduit examples?


part b

actually you should start it on a white panel
then it should print out eight capital letters, that you should submit
