part a

its a gravity simulation of the moons of Jupiter

at each timestep you want to
- apply gravity: the velocities get a queued set of changes
    for each pair of moons, each coordinate of their velocities gets +1, 0, -1 based on positions
- apply velocities: update positions by adding velocity to each


the energy of a moon is the sum of absolute values of the position and velocity coords

what is the total energy of the system after 1000 steps?


part b

how many steps does it take for to reach a state that matches a previous state?
not necessarily an initial state, just one seen before
as the examples show it can take a realllllly long time (one of the examples takes 4 billion), so you need some mega efficient solution


the strat: x, y, z evolve independently
    so find the x, y, z periods and then do some lcm magic

in fact all of them repeat back to the initial state, so can just lcm the repeat times
