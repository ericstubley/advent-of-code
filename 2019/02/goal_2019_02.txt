part a

it's intcode time
an intcode program is a list of integers, which self-modifies
the opcodes you know are 1, 2, 99
1, x, y, z takes the ints at position x, y and stores x+y into position z
2, x, y, z takes the ints at position x, y and stores x*y into position z
99 halts the program

after executing an instruction you jump ahead 4 to the next instruction


before running the program, replace position 1 with 12 and position 2 with 2
what is the result in position 0?


part b

you want to determine which pairs of inputs produces the output 19690720
the outputs are what you load into positions 1 and 2 (the noun and the verb)
what is 100*noun + verb (this is what gives 1202 in part a)


let's brute force things first, then understand the program
