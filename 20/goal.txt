part a

input consists of a single 512 character line (enhancement algorithm) and image
enhance the image by the following
    - take a 3x3 square around a pixel
    - flatten it
    - convert to binary number
    - use that index in the algorithm as new pixel

pretend the image is infinite in all directions
how many pixels are lit after enhancing twice?

part b

how many pixels are lit after enhancing 50 times?

today's program was quite slow in part b, to the level of like 30 seconds total
