part a

there's sea cucumbers on the sea floor.
they come in two herds, east moving (>) and south moving (v)
the east moving ones move first, then the south moving ones
movement wraps around the grid

what is the first step when there's no more movement?

today's code was slower than I would have liked for such a simple problem
rather than tracking a whole grid another possible solution would be to just store east and south positions and grid size
not clear that would be faster
maybe having to % every time is slowing it done


part b

we did it!


post-mortem:
- ah my friend of a few weeks, np.roll, how do I keep forgetting about you?
- someone repped the east and south sets as big numbers (I guess a binary string of length height*width), move by bitshifting??? sure would be a way to do it
